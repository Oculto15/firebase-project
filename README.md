# Overview

In this project, I am trying to develop a web page that connects to a database (Firebase) to store students information. The page will provide the option to manipulate the information stored in the cloud as well as delete it and enter new information.

The website will have different pages where they can manipulate the information entered. On the other hand, the database will have different tables related to each other, so you can enter specific information about each student.

The purpose of creating this project is to further develop my skills in working on projects that require front-end and a database. Create tables that relate to each other and be able to display the information to the user.
